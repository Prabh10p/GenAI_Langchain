Through twists of days, the paths may bend,
A trial begins, but trials end.
When shadows press and doubts are near,
Hold steady, for the light is clear.
The storm may rise, the skies may gray,
But dawn will always find its way.
So keep your hope, let courage stayâ€”
New strength is born with every day.2
